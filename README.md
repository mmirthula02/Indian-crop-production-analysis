# Project Title :  Indian crop production analysis

## Technologies : Python and Tableau for EDA and Visualizations (Buisness Intelligence)

### Domain : Agriculture

### Problem statement : 

The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is expected
to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are taking place on
the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel Business-to-Business
collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the
collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, in an
effective and flexible manner.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging
from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop
production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and metrics that
influence the crop production.

### Tools :

- Data Cleaning (EDA) - Python (Pandas & Numpy)
- Visualizations - Python (Matplotlib)
- Dashboard - Tableau

### Data Cleaning :


### Visualisations and insights gained 


### Dashboard :

- South Zone wise - High production crops : Kerala followed by Andhara Pradhesh & Tamil Nadu
- North Zone wise  - High production crops : Uttar Pradhesh followed by Punjab and Harayana
- Production rate for categorical crops : Commercial crops are yeilded the most in high productions
- Production rate for different tyoes of crops : Coconut is yeilded in high rate
- Production rate from 1197 to 2015 : Steady growth fron 2011 to 2015 & higher production in 2011
- Production rate for different season: In whole year season the crops are yeilded in subsequent amount followed by Kharif and Rabi
- Production rate statewise - Kerala followed by A.P ,T.N and U.P
- Area in sq.ft allocated for crop production in different states of India - Kerala , M.P
- Domination of states in regards to different categorical crops - Uttarpradesh provides a variety of categorical crops and its greater in production wise compared to other states.
