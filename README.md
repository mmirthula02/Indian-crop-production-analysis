# Project Title :  Indian crop production analysis

## Technologies : Python and Tableau for EDA and Visualizations (Buisness Intelligence)

### Domain : Agriculture

### Problem statement : 

The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is expected
to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are taking place on
the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel Business-to-Business
collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective, which aims to facilitate the
collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to associated business domains, in an
effective and flexible manner.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging
from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop
production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and metrics that
influence the crop production.
